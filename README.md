# uscoronavirusinfo

Dashboard/website containing information regarding COVID-19 in the U.S.

NOTE! Best version to run this is Python 3.7 or higher

To run it locally: `python covid_cases_main.py`

I am no longer able to host this web application/dashboard on Heroku anymore. Currently figuring out an alternative place to host it on!
